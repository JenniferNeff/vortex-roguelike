Plot:

The player has just been hired as a monster slayer at the Vortex Datacenter. Monsters are breeding in the colocation area, and one of the cabinets opens into a dungeon below the datacenter. Occasionally, threats must be battled in the digital world, which is a parallel universe where things behave a little differently.

How the maps work:
1. load a map by reading in a picture of walls and floor.
2. The walls and floor form the "base" layer of the map. (1 of 3)
3. The "object" layer (2 of 3) starts empty, and objects are added to it.
4. The "creature" layer includes the player, monsters, and other NPCs.

Notable monsters:

The "pancake syrup" oozes:
  Boston Molasses Monster (the boss)
  Pure Maple Syrup
  Agave Syrup
  Cheap "Breakfast" Syrup

Q

Will mess with you and move objects around.
If you talk to him while Fluttershy is your companion, he will become friendly, and will rescue you from one death.

Chess pieces

Move just like their namesakes. Pawns always begin adjacent to a wall, walk to the other side, and self-promote. If you corner the king he will surrender, and trigger some interesting event.
