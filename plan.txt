Plot:

The player has just been hired as a monster slayer at the Vortex Datacenter. Monsters are breeding in the colocation area, and one of the cabinets opens into a dungeon below the datacenter. Occasionally, threats must be battled in the digital world, which is a parallel universe where things behave a little differently.

How the maps work:
1. load a map by reading in a picture of walls and floor.
2. The walls and floor form the "base" layer of the map. (1 of 3)
3. The "object" layer (2 of 3) starts empty, and objects are added to it.
4. The "creature" layer includes the player, monsters, and other NPCs.

Notable monsters:

The "pancake syrup" oozes:
  Boston Molasses Monster (the boss)
  Pure Maple Syrup
  Agave Syrup
  Cheap "Breakfast" Syrup

Q

Will mess with you and move objects around.
If you talk to him while Fluttershy is your companion, he will become friendly, and will rescue you from one death.

Chess pieces

Move just like their namesakes. Pawns always begin adjacent to a wall, walk to the other side, and self-promote. If you corner the king he will surrender, and trigger some interesting event.

Conwayans

Oozes or mosses that breed according to the Game of Life. One move by the player always equals one of their ticks. The player is damaged whenever a conwayan tries to breed on the space where the player is standing. (This breeding attempt fails; therefore the player's presence disrupts the pattern.)

 - The conwayans on a particular floor are driven by an invisible entity that tracks the player's speed and calculates the next arrangement for any given turn. Whenever the player moves, this appeals to the Life Engine, which does the following:
  -- Locate all conwayans present on the level
      (if none, the Engine self-destructs to conserve resources)
  -- Locate all eligible neighbor-cells of existing conwayans
  -- For all aforementioned cells, decide if it lives or dies
  -- Enact the change
      Every conwayan is born with the average (mean? median?) of its parents' hit points. Conwayans heal gradually for every tick they remain alive. Thus the whole mass is injured as if a larger organism. Stronger variants heal instantaneously, so that careful heavy strikes that disrupt patterns are the only way to kill them.

Food and Drinks:

Player's hunger meter runs from 0 to 2000 (a reference to the average human's calorie needs of approximately 2000 calories per day; allows real calorie amounts to be used for foods).

If a player tries to eat something that would overflow the health meter by any amount, they instead get the message "You're not hungry enough to eat that."

"Healthy" foods decrease fatigue slightly when eaten.

Mesa Bar - Lightweight, moderately filling, healthy.
Mesa Negra Bar - A Mesa Bar with light caffeine.
Green Tea - Beverage with light caffeine; healthy.
Black Tea - Beverage with medium caffeine.
Black Coffee - Beverage with high caffeine.
Iced Latteccino - Beverage with medium caffeine; moderately filling.
Lotta Latteccino - Beverage with medium caffeine; filling.
Cold Pizza - Filling food.
Gyro - Filling, healthy.
Trail Mix - Filling.

Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans - caffeinated, but not a beverage.

Sandwiches:
Meatball Sub - Filling.

Combat mechanics:

Each entity has a "pool" for attack and defense.

When A attacks B:
 1. A rolls attack, B rolls defense.
 2. If A rolls higher the attack hits; otherwise it misses.
      Add later: if A rolls higher than B's entire pool, it's a crit
 3. Melee damage = base damage + gear bonuses

Need shouts for:
 x Hit with a melee attack
 x Miss with a melee attack
 o 


Poisons:
 Act every x ticks, with y damage, until z total damage has been inflicted (some of which may have been resisted).
 Poisons can be very fast or very slow acting, for added drama! Perhaps a poisonous mushroom hits for 2000 HP, 2000 ticks in the future...but it can be cured before that point, if possible...
 Healing poison reduces z, so the effect is not immediate; it usually reduces the amount of time one is affected. In the case of the "hits once for a lot" poison it will reduce the impact of that one hit.
